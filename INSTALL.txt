      USAGE
----------------------

   Place JACKplugin.dll in OBS's plugin folder. The audio output sources
   in JACK will become available during streaming/previewing. 

   The plugin will disconnect from JACK upon stopping the stream/preview. 
   If you do not wish to reconfigure JACK each time you start streaming
   you may use the JACK control program that comes with JACK to 
   automatically relink your audio sources for you.
